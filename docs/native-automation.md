# Native delivery contract

The supported OpenCode 2.2.5 plugin uses public `session.get`, `synthetic`,
`context`, hooks, events, storage and tool transforms. The root npm package exposes
one server plugin, `matuto.psst`; no classic or optional alternate entry is shipped.

- A durable private host/native-session binding and exclusive SQLite ownership
  keep inboxes isolated. Same-session reopen retains the original broker identity.
- Exact payload, native ID and injection ID commit before the single
  `synthetic({delivery:"queue",resume:true})` effect. Receipt validation compares
  session, ID, type, delivery and complete payload, not HTTP success alone.
- At most one native item is pending. Native cancellation removes the host's
  idempotency lookup, so uncertain delivery never automatically retries synthetic
  admission. Read-only context proof can reconcile promotion; missing, cancelled,
  compacted or mismatched evidence remains blocked rather than reinjected.
- Interrupt/failure pauses delivery. Subsequent native execution can reopen the
  event pause. Move/archive/delete/unload fence the exact owner; resumable unload
  does not terminally close its surviving broker identity.
- Peer messages are native synthetic machine-origin input, not human authority.
  Agent/model selection, drafts and native permissions remain unchanged.
- Private operation IDs include the verified native call identity and original
  assistant tool timestamp. An aged replay after journal GC fails closed.

The public-ID correction preserves approved filesystem state. Identity recovery
requires a single proven private anchor; old unapproved setup-owner records cannot
be read from another host plugin namespace and remain inert. See the README.
